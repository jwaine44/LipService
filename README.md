# LipService - Jared Waine's C# stack project, made in collaboration with CAdams3443

This project was created with the following technologies: C#, ASP.NET 6.0, Entity Framework Core, Razor, Bootstrap, MySQL, and the Twitter API. Please refer to the Screenshots folder for some visuals of the project in action.

## About

This project is intended for letting users (who may be up and coming musical artists) submit their lyrics for the application's algorithm to parse into searchable tweets that the user can then use to go to Twitter in order to interact with a fan who posted their lyrics but didn't tag them.

## Home Page

Here the user can register or login to their account. Before registering, they can click on one of the four sample lyrics to be taken to a page of tweets that contain that lyric in order to test out the application's functionality.

## Dashboard

After logging in, the user can click on the buttons to either add a song or be taken to the uploaded songs page.

## Add a song

Here the user can input a song's name and lyrics. Handy directions tell the user what to expect.

## One song page

After adding a song or clicking on an individual song in their uploaded songs page, the user is taken to this page, where the song's lyrics are parsed into nine word snippets. Each snippet is a clickable button. Handy directions tell the user what to expect.

## All tweets page

After clicking on a lyric snippet, the user is directed to this page, which displays up to one hundred tweets that contain the song lyric. Clicking on each tweet takes the user directly to the tweet on Twitter so they can interact with the tweeter.

## Uploaded songs page

Here the user is presented with all of the song titles of their uploaded songs. Clicking on a title will take them to the individual song's page.
